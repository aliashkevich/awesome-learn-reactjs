Curated list of resources to help you get started with React and Testing


## What is React?

* React is a JavaScript library - one of the most popular ones, with over [100,000 stars on GitHub](https://github.com/facebook/react).
* React is not a framework (unlike Angular, which is more opinionated).
* React is an open-source project created by Facebook.
* React is used to build user interfaces (UI) on the front end.
* React is the view layer of an MVC application (Model View Controller)

One of the most important aspects of React is the fact that you can create components, which are like custom, reusable HTML elements, to quickly and efficiently build user interfaces. React also streamlines how data is stored and handled, using state and props.
